WHEN DEALING WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE FOR
  THE FULL-TEXT-SEARCH ENGINE TO DIRECTLY SCAN THE CONTENTS OF TH
E  DOCUMENTS WITH EACH QUERY, A STRATEGY CALLED "SERIAL SCANNING.
"  THIS IS WHAT SOME TOOLS, SUCH AS GREP, DO WHEN SEARCHING.  HOW
EVE R, WHEN THE NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS TO SEARCH IS POTENTIALLY LARG
E, O R THE QUANTITY OF SEARCH QUERIES TO PERFORM IS SUBSTANTIAL, 
THE P ROBLEM OF FULL-TEXT SEARCH IS OFTEN DIVIDED INTO TWO TASKS:
 INDEX ING AND SEARCHING. THE INDEXING STAGE WILL SCAN THE TEXT O
F ALL T HE DOCUMENTS AND BUILD A LIST OF SEARCH TERMS (OFTEN CALL
ED AN IN DEX, BUT MORE CORRECTLY NAMED A CONCORDANCE). IN THE SEA
RCH STAGE , WHEN PERFORMING A SPECIFIC QUERY, ONLY THE INDEX IS R
EFERENCED,  RATHER THAN THE TEXT OF THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS.[2]  T
HE INDEXER  WILL MAKE AN ENTRY IN THE INDEX FOR EACH TERM OR WORD
 FOUND IN A  DOCUMENT, AND POSSIBLY NOTE ITS RELATIVE POSITION WI
THIN THE DOCU MENT. USUALLY THE INDEXER WILL IGNORE STOP WORDS (S
UCH AS "THE" A ND "AND") THAT ARE BOTH COMMON AND INSUFFICIENTLY 
MEANINGFUL TO B E USEFUL IN SEARCHING. SOME INDEXERS ALSO EMPLOY 
LANGUAGE-SPECIFI C STEMMING ON THE WORDS BEING INDEXED. FOR EXAMP
LE, THE WORDS "DR IVES", "DROVE", AND "DRIVEN" WILL BE RECORDED I
N THE INDEX UNDER  THE SINGLE CONCEPT WORD "DRIVE." RECALL MEASUR
ES THE QUANTITY OF  RELEVANT RESULTS RETURNED BY A SEARCH, WHILE 
PRECISION IS THE MEA SURE OF THE QUALITY OF THE RESULTS RETURNED.
 RECALL IS THE RATIO  OF RELEVANT RESULTS RETURNED TO ALL RELEVAN
T RESULTS. PRECISION I S THE NUMBER OF RELEVANT RESULTS RETURNED 
TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF  RESULTS RETURNED. THE DIAGRAM AT RIGHT RE
PRESENTS A LOW-PRECISION , LOW-RECALL SEARCH. IN THE DIAGRAM THE 
RED AND GREEN DOTS REPRES ENT THE TOTAL POPULATION OF POTENTIAL S
EARCH RESULTS FOR A GIVEN  SEARCH. RED DOTS REPRESENT IRRELEVANT 
RESULTS, AND GREEN DOTS REP RESENT RELEVANT RESULTS. RELEVANCY IS
 INDICATED BY THE PROXIMITY  OF SEARCH RESULTS TO THE CENTER OF T
HE INNER CIRCLE. OF ALL POSSI BLE RESULTS SHOWN, THOSE THAT WERE 
ACTUALLY RETURNED BY THE SEARC H ARE SHOWN ON A LIGHT-BLUE BACKGR
OUND. IN THE EXAMPLE ONLY ONE R ELEVANT RESULT OF THREE POSSIBLE 
RELEVANT RESULTS WAS RETURNED, S O THE RECALL IS A VERY LOW RATIO
 OF 1/3 OR 33%. THE PRECISION FOR  THE EXAMPLE IS A VERY LOW 1/4 
OR 25%, SINCE ONLY ONE OF THE FOUR  RESULTS RETURNED WAS RELEVANT
.[3]  DUE TO THE AMBIGUITIES OF NAT URAL LANGUAGE, FULL TEXT SEAR
CH SYSTEMS TYPICALLY INCLUDES OPTION S LIKE STOP WORDS TO INCREAS
E PRECISION AND STEMMING TO INCREASE  RECALL. CONTROLLED-VOCABULA
RY SEARCHING ALSO HELPS ALLEVIATE LOW- PRECISION ISSUES BY TAGGIN
G DOCUMENTS IN SUCH A WAY THAT AMBIGUIT IES ARE ELIMINATED. THE T
RADE-OFF BETWEEN PRECISION AND RECALL IS  SIMPLE: AN INCREASE IN 
PRECISION CAN LOWER OVERALL RECALL WHILE  AN INCREASE IN RECALL L
OWERS PRECISION.[4]
